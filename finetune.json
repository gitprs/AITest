Alternatively, if you wanted to charge the hysterectomy without a -22 and add another unlisted procedure for the excision of infected pelvic mass you could bill as follows: (payers sometimes reject unlisted codes performed adjacent to a coded procedure) 58150 - Total abdominal hysterectomy (corpus and cervix), with or without removal of tube(s), with or without removal of ovary(s); 58999- Unlisted procedure, female genital system (nonobstetrical) 57106 - Vaginectomy, partial removal of vaginal wall; 50949 - Unlisted laparoscopy procedure, ureter"}]},
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "Mark is a knowledgeable and encouraging medical coding chatbot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A patient had penile erosion due to a chronic catheter. The physician did a modified tubularized incised plate urethroplasty and a glansplasty to correct that problem. Most often this type of procedure is used with hypospadias correction, but the patient does not have hypospadias. Here is the description of the procedure - A glans stitch was placed. A 24 fr sound was placed into the urethra without any issue and it appeared that we would be able to bring together glans without tension. We then marked the edges of the urethral plate, eventually creating a U shape incision. We then made a superficial incision with a 15 blade and then the glans wings were further mobilized laterally with scissors to enable subsequent tension-free approximation over the urethra. Care was taken to preserve sufficient wing thickness for suturing while avoiding perforation into the sides of the urethral plate. We also incised the midline of the urethral plate to further assist with obtaining a tension free anastomosis. We then proceeded with tabularization using 4-0 PDS in an interrupted fashion. We ensured that all epithelium of the urethral plate was turned into the lumen. Once this was reapproximated with interrupted stitches we ran a 4-0 vicryl from the distal to proximal aspect of the newly tubularized urethra. We ensured the meatus remained patent enough. We then dissected a flap of dartos ventrally and mobilized it proximally enough so that it could comfortably cover the suture line. Prior to proceeding further, hemostasis was ensured. This was tacked over the anastomosis with 4-0 vicryl. We then proceeded with our glansplasty. Using 4-0 PDS we approximated the dermis and then the epidermis with interrupted 4-0 vicryl. A urethral stent was placed and fixed to the glans. Dermabond was applied over the incision. Patient was then cleaned, awoken, and transferred to PACU in stable condition. What CPT codes would you recommend for this? "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Agreed all the codes that are close to the description are associated with hypospadias. In this instance, we would recommend using the 55899 and reference back to the hypospadias code that most closely describes the procedure performed."}]},

Trying to determine the correct type of bill code to use since there is a category, special facility that includes an ASC, and then there is the stand-alone hospital category. Previously, we were using TOB 0831 for our outpatient surgeries in our ASC, but wondering now if we should be using 0131 under this program considering its intent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We could not find any information on the number of ASC providers participating in the Medicare Part A Hospital Without Walls program. CMS is allowing hospitals to provide hospital inpatient and outpatient services in temporary expansion sites, which may include ASCs or other sites. If a hospital meets the Conditions of Participation (CoPs) in effect during the COVID-19 PHE while operating one or more temporary expansion sites, Medicare will pay for covered Medicare inpatient or outpatient services provided at those sites as if they were provided at the permanent inpatient or outpatient locations of the hospital. An ASC may furnish inpatient services under arrangement for a hospital, or become provider-based to a hospital, or choose to enroll as a hospital themselves. If an ASC enrolls as a hospital, they must meet the hospital CoPs, to the extent not waived, and may provide any hospital inpatient or outpatient service provided that it operates in a manner not inconsistent with the State emergency preparedness or pandemic plan. The ASC would be functioning as a full hospital and may provide any hospital service as they would be functioning as a hospital rather than an ASC. ASCs that do not provide hospital services under arrangements to an existing hospital or that do not enroll as a hospital themselves may furnish only those services on the ASC Covered Procedures List, and consider the recommendations to delay all elective surgeries as noted in the QSO-20-22 memo: For ASCs that enroll as a Hospital and meet all other criteria are met, Medicare would provide a CMS Certification Number (CCN) for the newly-enrolled hospital. The newly-enrolled hospital can bill using new CCN following standard billing practices for inpatient and outpatient services and add “DR” condition code for patients in all new locations. For Hospitals that rent space from ASC or Convert their ASC to a Hospital and the care furnished in new inpatient space meets the refined CoPs, the hospital bills under their existing CCN following standard billing practices for inpatient or outpatient services and add “DR” condition code for patients in all new locations. In this case, the hospital will bill for the services provided, not the ASC. Since the guidance is that services should be billed using standard billing practices for hospital inpatient/outpatient services, bill type 0111 should be used to report inpatient services provided and 0131 for outpatient services or if applicable, another appropriate bill type."}]},

So in the example, you provided, at the visit for dysuria the nurse did provide an evaluation service so it would be appropriate to bill the 99211. In the subsequent visit if the only service provided was the UA then you should just report the UA. However, if in that visit, the nurse discusses the additional treatment for the UA findings then an E&M service was provided and the 99211 should be billed."}]}
